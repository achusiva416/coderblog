          <div class="col-lg ">
         
           <p class="lh-lg">ReactJS, also known as React, is a well-known open-source 
           JavaScript front-end library for creating dynamic and interactive applications and improving UI/UX design. Basically, it’s 
           responsible only for the view layer. Facebook initially developed and maintained the technology, which was then used in some 
           of its products, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. With frameworks such as Next.js, React can be utilized for developing single-page, 
           mobile, or server-side applications. It allows code to be debugged more efficiently by separating it into components.

            More than 220,000 websites currently utilize React. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites
           include Apple, PayPal, BBC, Dropbox, Reddit, and Netflix.

          <div class="col-lg ">
            
            <p class="lh-lg">AngularJS is an open-source Javascript front-end framework and is an integral part of the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, 
            Angular, And Node.js). It is mostly used for developing single-page web applications (SPAs). Since it’s a flexible framework, 
            developers can create progressive web apps or
             integrate the framework with technologies such as Ionic, Cordova, or NativeScripy to design near-native mobile applications.

            The tool has inbuilt templates that make it easy for developers to build UI views quickly. AngularJS provides simple, fast 
            data binding without developer intervention. By supporting caching, it reduces the CPU’s workload. It provides fast loading 
            and less navigation, ensuring an effective user experience. Gmail, Forbes, Upwork,  Deutsche Bank, etc., are some of the 
            popular websites and applications built using Angular.js.

          <div class="col-lg ">
            
            <p class="lh-lg">The popular Javascript framework ‘Vue.js’ was created by Evan You and used to develop interactive UIs (User Interfaces) 
            (UIs) and SPAs (Single-page applications). Vue.js is one of the best JavaScript frameworks for creating a lightweight and 
            adaptable interactive UI elements. The MVVM model (Model View-View Model) architecture pattern and its lightweight nature
             make Vue.js extremely easy to implement.

            HTML and CSS knowledge is required to use Vue.js. Also, Vue.js has a core library focused solely on the view layer. 
            Frameworks like this can be seamlessly integrated into big projects for front-end development without causing any 
            problems or issues. 9GAG, GitLab, Nintendo, Behance, and Laravel are some of the popular websites and applications 
            built using Vue.js.

            and native-like apps with the help of a singular codebase. This is one of the fastest-growing frontend frameworks for 
            creating flexible and effective web designs. Its ability to create native capabilities and expressive elements on iOS 
            and Android platforms is a major factor driving its popularity.

            Flutter enables developers to create cross-platform apps quickly using the Dart programming language and the 
            Skia graphical engine. Flutter – Dart makes it easy for developers to create apps fast. The Flutter framework 
            is designed primarily for mobile applications running on both Android and iOS. A few of the giants that use this

              elements of responsive websites quickly and easily. With its pre-built components, users can add themes and icons to their designs.

            The Bootstrap framework was initially developed by Twitter and has become the most popular front-end framework available today.
              Bootstrap is very easy to use since developers only need basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge. A few of the giants that use this

             s developers to discover, install, and develop Node programs, as well as discover reusable packages of code and reassemble
              them according to their priorities. It is considered to be the largest software registry in the world. npm is a
               command-line tool used to install, update, and uninstall Node.js packages and modules in an application.

            Over 350,000 packages make npm an essential front-end tool for JavaScript developers looking to share their code

            it has earned a reputation as an ideal, easy-to-use solution for rapid prototyping and developing cross-platform code 
            (iOS, Web, Android). The array of packages provided, the node.js and MongoDB foundation it relies on, and the code 
            flexibility it offers make Meteor an excellent tool for building robust, secure real-time web applications as well as
             handling everything from the browser applications to a database or server.

            It is claimed that Meteor can be used for both the front-end and back-end development of mobile, web and desktop
             applications. Yet, building the entire application using only Meteor for multiple platforms might not be the most 
             rational move. A few of the giants that use this platform for their applications/websites include Honeywell, Mixmax,

          <div class="col-lg ">
           
           <p class="lh-lg"> Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering 
            and generating static websites. React is a JavaScript library that is traditionally used to build web applications
             rendered in the client's browser with JavaScript.[8] Developers recognize several problems with this strategy however,
              such as not catering to users who do not have access to JavaScript or have disabled it, potential security issues, 
              significantly extended page loading times, and harm to the site's overall search engine optimization. Frameworks 
              such as Next.js sidestep these problems by allowing some or all of the website to be rendered on the server-side 
              before being sent to the client. Next.js is one of the most popular frameworks for React
